# Middlewares library

Today, we will build a middlewares library. It aims to be a collection of useful middlewares that can be imported and used in different common scenarios.

We already provide a list of predefined middlewares you will need to implement

### RequestLoggingMiddleware

### SSLRedirectMiddleware

### WWWRedirectMiddleware

### ExceptionLoggingMiddleware

Add pending test cases

Upload the django app as a "reusable app" to pypi
